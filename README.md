# RIMSAR: Refractive Index Matched Suspension Analysis and Rheometry Library

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a set of analysis and rheometry tools to analyse a rotating immersed granular flow consisting of glass particles in a benzyl alcohol/ethanol mixture. The experimental process behind this is given in XX. The idea here is to using statistical inference and machine learning to infer interesting data, such as pressure and stress fields and rheological models.
